# TSA_Software_Development_2018
Do not edit anything ye public people, it is already hard enough to get GitHub to work and having random people mess with our private project
for our class isn't good.

TO ANYONE IN THE TEAM:
Push changes to the Development branch then once we're in a stable position we will merge the master and development branch.
