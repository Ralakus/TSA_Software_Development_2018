# TSA_Software_Development_2018
Do not edit anything ye public people, it is already hard enough to get GitHub to work and having random people mess with our private project
for our class isn't good.

#What is this about?
The project is meant to ease the process of making a decision by making the user(s) thoroughly go through the process of making a decision step-by-step 
with the guidance of the program.

#TO ANYONE IN THE TEAM:
How to use GitHub.

* Find a directory you want this repository. 
* Use command "git clone <insert url here>" which should clone this repository onto your drive
* cd into the repository folder
* Type "git pull" so it updates what is on your PC
* To add a file, type "git add . " it should add all changes to git
* After that, it is recommended to type "git status" to see what will change
* Then you wanna type "git commit -m "[insert message about what was changed]"" to commit the changes
* After you commit, you have to type "git push" to push the changes onto the repository.
