Do not edit anything ye public people, it is already hard enough to get GitHub to work and having random people mess with our private project
for our class isn't good.

TO ANYONE IN THE TEAM:
How to use GitHub.

find a directory you want this repository. 
Use command "git clone <insert url here>" which should clone this repository onto your drive
cd into the repository folder
type "git pull" so it updates what is on your PC
to add a file, type "git add . " it should add all changes to git
After that, it is recommended to type "git status" to see what will change
Then you wanna type "git commit -m "<insert message about what was changed>"" to commit the changes
After you commit, you have to type "git push" to push the changes onto the repository.

BUGS:
Scanner splits string into different words creating different alternative listings
